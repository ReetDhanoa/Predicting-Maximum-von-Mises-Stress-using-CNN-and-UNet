# Predicting-Maximum-von-Mises-Stress-using-CNN-and-UNet
– Solved for maximum von Mises stress in a composite domain with random material distribution using deep learning. 
– Implemented CNN for direct regression and UNet to reconstruct the stress field and extract peak stress. 
– Compared both approaches on accuracy, computational complexity, and data requirements using 10,000 FEM-simulated samples
